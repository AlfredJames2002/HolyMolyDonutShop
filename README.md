# HolyMolyDonutShop
This was my first programming project. I completed this project as part of an assignment for CS3300 Object Oriented Programming in Fall 2023 with my partner, who was also a student in the class. We received a grade of 110 for the assignment. 

## Project Overview
The Donut Shop Project is a Java-based application designed to simulate the operations of a small donut shop. It provides an interactive user interface to manage orders, display menu items, calculate costs, and handle payments, offering a streamlined experience for both customers and shop staff.

## Features
Order Management: Place order.

Menu Display: View available donut flavors, beverage options, and prices.

Price Calculation: Automatically calculate the total cost of an order with taxes.

Payment Processing: Simulate payment options and generate receipts for completed orders.

## Technologies Used
Java: Core language for business logic and application structure.

Swing: GUI is used for the front end.

Object-Oriented Programming: Organized code using classes for different functionalities.
